This is what I have so far. Looks underwhelming and the account image has these lines around it when I use it in Tkinter. Think I should add something else? Like colors? Maybe make it like the other login page. Anyways I'm sending it your way now. GGs.
Note: Tell me what you think of the new sign in window.

1:12 AM: Just messed around a bit with the SIMS-QC home window.
You can check it out but I'm just pushing the changes so it's not done

Oh btw found a tutorial on how to link tkinter and mysql using mysql connector for a database 
in a restaurant. Pretty similar to ours. Was helpful. You can check it out if you wanna.
