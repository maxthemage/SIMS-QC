This is what I have so far. Looks underwhelming and the account image has these lines around it when I use it in Tkinter. Think I should add something else? Like colors? Maybe make it like the other login page. Anyways I'm sending it your way now. GGs.
Note: Tell me what you think of the new sign in window.

1:12 AM: Just messed around a bit with the SIMS-QC home window.
You can check it out but I'm just pushing the changes so it's not done

Oh btw found a tutorial on how to link tkinter and mysql using mysql connector for a database 
in a restaurant. Pretty similar to ours. Was helpful. You can check it out if you wanna.

2:09 PM: Okay added I have and worked on so far.
Please give me some feedback as to any frontend functionality or styles.
Also you can go ahead and try merging the frontend and backend.
Most of the backend stuff that's needs to be added will be done in;
login_beta.py, create_beta.py, display_beta.py update_beta.py & delete_beta.py.
There are functions there that collect data from entry fields to be added to the 
database. The only function that really retrieves data from the DB is display.
Also the way I was doing would work but if the DB is update or anything the 
changes won't be reflected. So you can go ahead and do it your way. Maybe use 
fetchall or something. I'm still waiting on Tia to finish the report part.
So that's the only major thing to be added
